We are using a dataset from \href{http://rebrickable.com/}{Rebrickable.com} on the inventories of every official LEGO set up to 2015. This dataset includes 9,992 lego sets, 21,089 unique pieces in 130 colors, with a total of 479,751 pieces between all sets. This dataset also includes images of 9,457 of the sets and most of the pieces. All data for the sets, pieces, colors, and maps between the pieces and sets are stored in csv files and the images are jpeg files. We have the following information in the fours csv files:

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Sets:} Includes an ID for each set, the year a set was released, the total number of pieces in a set, and a category and brief description for each set. \\

\item {\bf Pieces:} Includes an ID, category and brief description for each piece.

\item {\bf Set Pieces:} Includes a set and piece ID, the number of times the piece is used in the set, the color of the piece in the set, and whether the piece is a normal or spare piece.


\item {\bf Colors:} Includes an ID and a brief description for each color.

\end{enumerate}
